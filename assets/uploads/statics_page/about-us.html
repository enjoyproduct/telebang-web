									<h2>The journey that we <strong>Choose</strong>&hellip;</h2>

<p class="lead">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to have a lot of friends in my school time. Just like other passionate youths, we are all excited to do something that matters in other people&rsquo;s lives. Some wanted to be respected engineers; others were trying to start something on their own. Starting a business in school year, we thought it is awesome! As thing went on, some of them came to me and complained that if only they have their own website, their journey would be much easier. Facing the reality, it was really expensive for them, not to mention that they had no technical knowledge about websites. The idea was there, but not until I met my friends, Linh &amp; David, I realized we could actually do something about it. Therefore, we founded Inspius&trade;. Our wish is to make amazing websites affordable to everyone, even those who have no technical understanding.&rdquo;<br /><em>Kyle &ndash; Co-founder, Inspius</em></p>
